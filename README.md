# Downloading_Data_Project
### Arewa Data Science Project
This project focused on downloading, processing, and visualizing data.

This project focused on the visualization of weather.
This project performs weather data analysis using CSV files and plots the results using Matplotlib. It is broken down into sections, each achieving a specific task. Here's an explanation of the code in sections:

 ### Necessary Libraries
The following libraries are imported for the script:
    **csv:** To read and process CSV files.
    **datetime:** To parse and work with date values.
   **matplotlib.pyplot:** To create plots for visualizing the data.


### Datasets Uused
 *sitka_weather_07-2018_simple.csv*
 *sitka_weather_2018_simple.csv*
 
 ### In Summary
 In summary this project include the following:
   1. Read weather data from CSV files.
   2. Extract relevant information like dates, high, and low temperatures.
   3. Visualize the data using line graphs, with additional features like shading to enhance interpretation. The workflow effectively combines data processing and visualization to analyze and present weather trends.
